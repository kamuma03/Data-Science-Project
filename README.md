# Fraud Detection Project
Data Science project for fraud detection with an unbalance dataset 

Dataset used from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/

Because of all in one notebook being quite big I had to devide the activities into two separate notebooks

Data analysis notebook covers the data analysis EDA part of the activity
  - This notebooks are from colab, so the data was imported from Google drive but can easily be imported from local drive by giving input the local folder
  - At the end of the notebook the data is saved with pickle in Google drive but it can be saved in local drive by changing the destination folder
  
  
Fraud Detection Model notebook covers the part of the modeling and dealing with unbalanced dataset
  - At the starting datasets are imported with pickle from Google drive but  it can be imported from local drive by changing the destination folder
